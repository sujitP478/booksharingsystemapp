 Here's a high-level low-level design for the Book Sharing App:

Components:

Controllers: Responsible for handling incoming requests, validating inputs, and invoking the appropriate services.
Services: Contain the business logic and interact with the data access layer.
Data Access Layer: Handles interactions with the database to perform CRUD operations on the entities.
Database: Stores the persistent data for books, users, requests, etc.
Kafka: Acts as a messaging system for sending notifications.
Design Considerations:

Follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to separate concerns and improve maintainability.
Use Spring Boot framework for developing RESTful APIs, as it provides support for validation, exception handling, and dependency injection.
Implement logging using a logging framework such as Log4j or Logback to capture application events and facilitate troubleshooting.
Utilize proper exception handling techniques, such as using custom exceptions, global exception handlers, and appropriate error response formats.
Implement input validation at the API level to ensure data integrity and prevent security vulnerabilities.
Use a relational database management system (RDBMS) like MySQL or PostgreSQL to store the application's data. Define proper database schemas and relationships to model entities.
Integrate Kafka to send notifications asynchronously. Publish events to a Kafka topic whenever there are relevant actions performed (e.g., adding a book, updating a request status).
Implement security measures, such as authentication and authorization, to protect sensitive data and control access to the API endpoints.
Utilize Java 8 features, such as lambdas, streams, and method references, to write concise and efficient code.
Add meaningful comments throughout the code to explain complex logic, assumptions, and edge cases.
Note: This is a high-level overview of the low-level design for the Book Sharing App. For a comprehensive and detailed low-level design, it is recommended to consider the specific requirements, technologies, and architectural preferences of your project.
